## Start project

- To start the project create a folder with the name of your project.
 "NAVBAR-COMPONENT REACT" in this case and open it in your editor of preference.

- Then inside your project folder run in your terminal "npx create-react-app navbar" 
(in this line "navbar" is the name that all the dependencies will be created and where you will create your navbar)  :)
